# Better Synergy Menu

[Better Synergy Menu on Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/better-synergy-menu) based on the original and no longer updated [Better Summoning Menu](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/better-summoning-menu)

## Overview

This mod refines the Summoning Synergy search function in Melvor Idle. When you click the Summoning Synergy search button within a skill, the list now automatically filters to display only the buffs that enhance the selected skill, instead of showing all buffs related to the familiar associated with that skill.

## Features

- **Improved Filtering**: Easily find synergies that specifically benefit the skill you're focusing on.
- **Streamlined Experience**: No more sifting through irrelevant buffs â€“ get straight to the synergies that matter.

## Installation

1. Visit the [Mod.io page](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/better-synergy-menu) for Better Synergy Menu.
2. Follow the installation instructions on the page.

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work seamlessly with Melvor Idle and should be compatible with other mods that do not alter the Summoning Synergy interface.
